      <p class="card-text">In todayâ€™s generation, the use of internet and technology in general has become more
        reliable, and in turn, people have become more reliant to technology. By having access to the internet, people
        can do so much things, with just a click, they can watch a video tutorial, send messages and access files
        from-and-to far away, and etc.,
      <p></p>Having a <b>community-driven platform</b> for users to interact with and access that can serve as a guide
      or reference for places they want to go to, may it be now, or in the future, can be a game changer for people
      looking for places to go or tour to.
      </p><p></p>
<p>This website will serve as a navigation platform for people looking for places that are currently trending if they want to go places that will pique their interest. The website will let people rate the place that went before and judge their experience in that certain place.  This will help people find particular places whether it is a restaurant, mall, or a store and will them decide if they want to go to that certain place because of the reviews of others that went there before.<p></p>
 As it is community-driven, <b>everyone can participate/post their review about the specific places they had gone to.</b>
